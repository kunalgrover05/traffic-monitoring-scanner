Issues

Number of devices being detected per scan wasn't consistent
Taking the union of MAC addresses after 2-3 scans gives a more accurate number of BT devices.

Device can detect at max. 10 devices per scan ( according to th website).

Device cannot distinguish between a vehicle and a person on the pavement.

Even though data is to be sent to mbt.txt file on sd card, an error props up, saying it can't open such a file.
